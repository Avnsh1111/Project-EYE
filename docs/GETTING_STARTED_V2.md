## 💡 Best Practices

### 1. Use Favorites Liberally

Star photos as you view them. Don't wait to organize later.

```
View → Like it? → Star it → Move on
```

### 2. Don't Fear Deletion

Photos go to trash first. You can always restore them.

```
Delete → Check trash later → Restore or permanent delete
```

### 3. Download Before Major Cleanup

Always backup before bulk operations.

```
Select All → Download → Then delete unwanted
```

### 4. Use Selection Mode for Bulk Tasks

Never do operations one-by-one.

```
Need to act on multiple? → Enter selection mode
```

### 5. Learn Keyboard Shortcuts

They're game-changers for speed.

```
Escape = Close/Cancel
Delete = Remove selected
Ctrl+A = Select all
```
